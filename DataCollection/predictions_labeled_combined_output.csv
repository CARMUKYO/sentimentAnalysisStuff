it is still hardly egocentric of leni to say she she will only run if bbm runs for president. the job in 2022 requires a lot of out a public servant who cares about the country. it will be tough on anyone. the president will be inheriting an economy with too much debt and a decimated tax base thanks for covid19. we really cant afford more corruption in government procurement especially if were only borrowing much of this money to keep things going. and it is also much harder to grow revenues in a postcovid world. i dont think the people who declared their intention to run fully understand whats at stake here for the next 6 years. populism and the traditional way of doing politics is not going to cut it anymore. but i can understand her very human reason to say she will only run if bbm does. dont forget bbm running for president makes it very personal for her. this guy dragged the issue and accused her of cheating and contested her win as vp while using actively using troll hate machinery against her. it took 3 years iirc until the supreme court unanimously upheld her win.,negative,positive,negative,negative,negative

"let's all just admit it, marcos jr is saying all these stuff about continuity, continuing the war on drugs, icc shield, dealing with china the same way, buildx3, blah blah blah because he wants to appear to the dds as the man to take digong's mantle and continue the admin. he is also saying all these so that pdplaban cusi faction and duterte will adopt or anoint him. and in addition to this, marcos jr will just say ""my platform is that of my father"" which can easily fool most filipinos no matter how vague. so far, duterte and his party have just snubbed him and even called on bato to be the continuity candidate. duterte has been eerily silent about marcos jr's public revelations that he was inviting dutz as vp and making light ineffective jokes about bongx3 alliance. but i dread the day that duterte becomes so desperate that they surrender to marcos jr's knocking.",negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

"super unpopular opinion.. surely i will get downvoted like hell for this but.. i really dislike leni followers and in a strange way, i also dislike leni. here's the kicker i actually really love leni for her overall values. to me, she is the most competent politician in the country for president. she is also easily the most dislikeable politician. i typically say she has the ""hillary clinton"" effect. choosing her as the main contender on the left to beat bbm jr. was a really bad move. as soon as i saw her running, i knew we will get another 6 years of shit presidency. immediately, i saw my fb feed full of my friends pretending to be willing to listen and have discourse with the typical dds crowd. ""we can do this. let's talk where it is needed. let's level with these people"", and the same friends in the next post say shit like ""dds do not talk to me, i have no time for your shit"" you cannot make this shit up.. fuck, i am the biggest dds hater on the planet and i have more discourse with dds people than all these dumb fake pretenders of ""i'll be pure and have real conversations with those people"".. it is depressing. the problem with leni is, that she primarily only appeals to the kind of people who used to be the way i used to be 23 years ago. seeing the world as very black and white. you're either of high moral values, or there is something wrong. the reality is, most of the world is complicated. god knows, pinoy voters who struggle with their livelihoods are complicated. people who vote for bbm jr. or duterte are complicated. i agree that purity as the main weapon to win this election is really inefficient. let's look at her branding pink.. not to be the bearer of bad news, but a lot of men nowadays absolutely hate this color. why? extreme feminism which constantly paints average men as a problem for misconducts of like 0.01 of men on the planet. i frankly feel kinda awful whenever i see leni crowds on the streets. leni's campaign screams ""to hell with the patriarchy!"" and it reflects in the fb posts of my leni supporting people. it gets tiring to constantly get an image projected that i am part of a problem just because i was born as a man. i get it, duterte will get a guiness world record as the world's biggest ahole. i still get annoyed that half of my fb feed frequently writes something negative about men. yesterday i saw a post by inka magnaye who if i am not mistaken is proleni who shared a post that bad driving has no gender and told men to fuck themselves for saying women are bad drivers. i googled ""gender differences men vs women"" and immediately found out in 2 minutes that men are 4 times worse drivers than women. in 10 seconds, she attacked people who need education and in the very same instance, shared an obvious falsehood. it is that alternative realitythinking of lenisupporters that gets super annoying. instead of just performing a 2minute google search to have useful discourse, leni people always need an enemy. be it men, duterte, patriarchy, bbm jr., dds voters. it gets annoying as hell to have a liberal feed of whiney idiots who have to cry about something nonstop instead of activating some of their brain cells for real substantial discourse to drive change in society. these people always act as they are the smartest people in the room but are too dumb to educate themselves on the most basic shit. when i talk with a good dds friend of mine, holy fuck man, we never ever agree on politics lol.. she could not be more hardcore ddsbbm jr., i could not be more anti. but when we talk, we have an actual exchange of ideas, instead of posting a dumb oneliner that a toddler would know is not true. when i talk to my leni friends to discuss a complex topic, i just cannot. they will literally ignore me if i say something that threatens their waytooblackandwhitereality. so they do not wanna hear anything that threatens their way of life, but they'll bombard you nonstop with how yours might be wrong. most people just wanna go on with their lives without some leftwing pinoy calling them out for having some wrong perspective on life because it is not pictureperfect enough. a struggling pinoy certainly has better things to do than being told about ""but xyz is wrong.."" how do these people expect voters to believe leni can lead them if their own followers cannot even keep up a normal conversation on fb? leni's positioning alienates every single voter who does not see everything in pure terms. leniism to me symbolizes what many critical thinkers dislike no capacity for outofthebox critical thought. people on the extreme left who always talk of high moral values tend to be as ignorant as extreme dds or bbm jr. followers in the sense that they are unable to see the world as it is. made up of complex issues, ideas variables that cannot be tackled with simple pure ideologies. i really like leni's values of her improving the country. i really want her to win. i do not think ph can survive another 6 years of unintelligent governance. but as soon as i saw her running for president and saw how it is being run, i was immediately mad at my pinoy friends, who are 99 very liberal, who just do not get it. nobody cares about you talking 247 about how everything can be done better. how everything should be clean. how everything is either bad or good. tldr pacquiao for president! charrot 😂",negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

possible. it is already 2021. that outdated campaign strategy will not work in an era of social media, fake news, performative communications, and mass disinformation. also, dump those who tell you that radical love and calm positivity will defeat populist, nostalgic, paternalistic, and strongman politics. a culture shaped by patriarchy and machismo does not consider love and positivity masculine or strong. they belong in churches and convents. i do not want to believe that you're recycling roxas' losing campaign strategies and messages that were also calm and collected, but your campaign looks that way. his ""disente"" and ""tuwid na daan"" were like your ""radikal na pagmamahal""virtuous, effete, conceited and ineffective. perhaps you're copying the calm strategies and positive messages of noynoy aquino in 2010 since arroyo's and duterte's administrations are models for corrupt governance and oppressive leadership, but there were no mass manipulations and political fakeries on social media then. noynoy aquino won in 2010 also because his mother just died, and her death caused mass necrophilic political support from the voters who were entertained by emotional telenovelas and those heroes in their nostalgia and memory. vp leni, you do not have that mourning scene for 2022. it is possible that you want to do your calm campaign and positive messages in 2016 again, but your ""hail mary"" campaign then did not make you win. cayetano's candidacy defeated marcos. the 2016 davao region election figures say so. sadly, the cayetano of 2022 already quitbong go. i am not dismissing the fact that calm, loving, positive election campaigns do work, but that is for incumbents and current administrations' candidates like arroyo in 2004 and marcos now. they will not go berserk and negative. they have to project that they are above their opponents. winning positive strategies are not really positive. in 2004, arroyo ran a positive campaign, but his supporters did the dirty job of belittling poe. the same thing will happen in 2022marcos is running a calm, positive campaign, while his rabid supporters are attacking robredo. a positive campaign strategy that is passive and does not attack or counter is for losers. elections are wars without bombs and guns but minds and mouths. they are not for saints. even good, righteous leaders become sinners when they campaign and govern like saints after they win. now let me illustrate your ineffective campaign that'll only waste a political movement and suggest remedies using the cases in india and the us. perhaps your people will defensively say that we're filipinos, but the cases i'll cite are similar to what we have in the philippines. the 2022 election in the philippines is following the indian general election in 2019. there were two main contenders for prime ministershipmodi paternalistic, nostalgic incumbent pm and gandhi reformist, idealistic opposition leader, almost like marcos versus robredo now. modi and gandhi projected love and positivity in their campaigns, but modi's supporters used lies, insults, fabricated images, and fake news against gandhi who did not attack or counter. like robredo who is called ""bobo"", gandhi, who went to cambridge, was called pappu child. like the education of marcos, modi's is so vague that many consider him semiliterate. gandhi was so like robredocalm, love, positivity, reforms, development, etc. in the end, modi won although his previous government reeked of corruption, cronyism, economic mismanagement, etc. two things can be learned from that indian case idealistic positivity and virtuous politics are losing strategies. attacks and counterattacks are necessary to win an election in an era of social media, mass disinformation, and manufactured narratives. passiveness is surrender. another thing happened in the 2019 indian election campaign that sealed the win of modi. there was a bombing incident in kashmir. before that, gandhi looked competitive. after that incident, the majority of indians opted for modi. gandhi's positivity and idealism came off weak. i am afraid the 2022 election will follow the path of the 2019 indian election. an explosion in manila will defeat robredo who has been attacked as weak and dumb using manufactured images and fabricated narratives that are unanswered because of radical love and calm positivity. our country is misogynistic. our culture demeans what is not macho. our collective consciousness degrades weaknesses. our society is ruled by patriarchy. oh, in our politics, women leaders are labeled as whores or lunatics and always as weaklings if they are not gros of patriarchy. vp leni, you have been called ""baliw"" and ""malandi"", and the attacks have failed to define and ruin you because the people see what you really are as our vice president. sadly, you still have another tag to deal with""mahina"". radical love and calm positivity will reinforce that. i am not all about criticism. i also suggest. i offer alternatives. so, let me use obama's campaign image and positive political campaign. like you, obama was a political outsider and he relied on his strong presidential image or on how people perceived him as a potential leader. from the 2004 democratic national convention to the 2008 presidential election, obama was about an image of strengthno drama, no clowning, but authenticity and audacity. during the 2008 election, he talked about hope and declared ""yes, we can"", but he countered when attacked. obama's campaign in 2008 was, indeed, positive, inspiring, hopeful, and visionary, but his antibush supporters were busy attacking republicans and their capitalist allies and friends who made money out of coffins and body bags. they were noisy, livid, and effective. i was there. maybe your people will counter that my views are americentric. well, social media, black propaganda, fake news, manufactured images, and fabricated narratives are american inventions. filipinos are just endusers. political greed in texas is not different from that greed in davao. vp leni, there is already a template for defeating populist demagogues and their hostile supporters like trump and those maga ""deplorables"" in 2020, besides uniting. movements, attacks and counterattacks online or offline and on social media or mainstream media worked for biden. like you who are dismissed as ""bobo"" or ""mahina"", biden was also attacked as old and senile, which did not really spread and root even though it could be possible based on his age. that was so because antitrump forces were not passive and weak. every lie was countered with truths. biden had two movements of blacks and of antitrump republicans. those movements were too far from radical love and calm positivity. biden focused on policies and reforms, while his supporters made attacking trump, republicans, maga, qanon their daily duty online and offline. we should learn from roxas' blunders in 2016. because he believed in ""disente"" and ""tuwid na daan"", he and his supporters did not attack duterte's ""3 to 6 months"" and counter the fabricated images and narratives unleashed by dds. please do not let the tallano gold spread and root. here's my suggestion allow the pink movement to attack and counterattack. separate yourself from that political aggression. let that movement organize a lincoln project or meidas touch. focus on policies and reforms. your image should be of strength. after all, you are our hope. i am not really sure why you want radical love and calm positivity to define your campaign when you should be talking about corruption, cronyism, economic crisis, chinese puppetry, mass hunger, ballooning poverty, etc. any movement exists not for love and quiet. that is so sixties. even the silent salt march of the mahatma or the nonviolent protest of that black minister who had a dream was not passive or weak. nonviolence may be physically passive, but their struggle for freedom was aggressive. vp leni, please do not waste the movement that is behind you. done.",negative,positive,negative,negative,negative

"where's the agricultural self sufficiency and widescale rural development? where's the ""boracay will have no casinos"" promise? if you look at duterte's approval rating, it is tied to peace and order. which again is pretty much an outgrowth of the drug war. duterte had a lot of broken promises, but he only had one truly big one in the election. hell, it is so influential candidates are literally taking drug tests just because of the mere accusation of cocaine use. by the way boracay is actually really clean now and he pissed off a lot of chinese people and pacquiao who literally had their properties sliced in half because they got too close to the water. i know because i visited the place several times in the pandemic, and most of the folks there were actually thrilled by duterte's ""iron fisted"" handling of the situation. do not believe your facebook feed until you have actually been to the places they claim duterte succeededfailed. a lot of it is just propaganda on both sides. the dolomite beach for instance was duterte propaganda, but boracay was definitely not a failure for duterte that is leni propaganda. i think we're arguing on the basis that voters actually have morals when in reality, i think filipino voters just virtue signal all of us, conservative, liberal and progressive and settle for lessin denial when their elected leaders fail to deliver and cover it up with excuses ""but at least he is honest"". maybe this is what we should be worrying about. no, that is leni's base primarily because you're the ones most affected by american politics. most filipinos have a very transactional view of politics. ""you build me this bridge and make my life easier, and i vote for you"". that is why promises and delivering on promises is so important. most filipinos are not entitled and driven by ideology. they do not feel that their politicians should embody their values. indeed in many regards they think that is stupid. they are driven by simple tangible delivery of services. that is why bb is the second most lauded accomplishment of duterte behind the drug war. moreover.. if duterte failed at his promises then it means he is not capable to begin with. if duterte's promises were not capable of being achieved, then maybe he should not have said them at all, but if he did not, then he'd also not have won. 65 of filipinos actually want duterte's medical records released. most in fact do believe he is sick ailing and no longer able to function and that is why they are giving him a pass for being ""ineffective"".",negative,negative,negative,negative,negative

"oh yes no, they are completely different people. i just meant the vibe she gives off to people. i find robredo has an image issue primarily because of the way she presents herself. she seems too inauthentic to me in her speech, as if she is always making sure to present herself from her very best angle, continuously forced smiling. very similar like clinton did. robredo's flaw to me is definitely the focus on purity, transparency, decency, loving values. not because they are bad values. but because people simply do not care sa ph. ph is a country of extreme polarities. most people supported the war on drugs. i have had friends who would cheer for the death of fellow pinoys, and a day later they'll go to church and i just think ""wtf"" i do not think that these are particular values most pinoys care about. i do not pretend to know everything pinoys care about, pero to me it seems pinoys want dominance, strength, decisiveness, even if it is only a facade. i also think leni probably has done more with the average workingclass in two years than bbm jr. probably did in his entire lifetime lol.. but she just does not know how to sell it in a sexy package. pointing to her track record ai not the way, you see it all the time. she clearly has the best track record, pero you see comments online all the time asking ""what has she done?"" i may be wrong but i think to the average pinoy voter it is about what they feel the candidate can do, rather than what they can see the candidate can do. and yep i also do not think she is playing identity politics her supporters certainly do though. the gender analogy was just an example of leni supporters who ignore things they do not like seeing, which causes them to be completely shut off from the average opinion in the country. there are other examples, like some leni supporters having a tendency to ignore positive covid newsstatistics even if a ddsbbm person would point it out. the leni supporter playbook does it make the people we hate dutertemarcos look good or does it not fit into our narrative? ignore it. and yea, that is what bbmdds do. i know. that is precisely why i dislike it and find it hypocritical and made a superlong rant about how full of shit many leni voters are. it is the other side of the coin. the way i see power dynamics sa ph is that there is an extreme left leni ""country is utterly broken"", center, extreme right bbm jr. ""martial law was not bad"". the center is where it is at. you can generate 100s of charts of how transparent leni is, or how bad martial law was, or point to leni's certifications and audits. nobody on the left or right cares. pero the people in the middle just care about simple ideas, like will we get a new highway, will i get new roads, will we have fewer drug pushers in our city, etc. because of that, it is not surprising to me that bbm jr. is the big winner in current surveys. bbm jr. tells stories, leni tells facts. people wanna be sold a good life story for themselves.",negative,positive,negative,negative,negative

"duterte had a lot of broken promises which shows that people do not really care about broken promises, because these would definitely be a mark against his leadership. i stand by my long term belief that this support is driven by double standards because if a leftist, progressive or socdem were in charge, their failures would be front and center and they'd be impeached for the slightest transgression. meanwhile, duterte can get away with anything because of his age and strong promises. now if people only approve of him because of law and order, then that is a result of people being singleissue voters and i honestly have nothing to say about that. that is the world we live in, deal with it i guess. boracay is actually really clean now and he pissed off a lot of chinese people i do not doubt boracay is clean. i do however call bs on his promise of having no casinos or resorts in the area, because it directly contradicts the environmental purpose of cleaning up the area. cannot have it both ways where one is environmental but also wants capitalist enterprise to flourish through the use of said area. if the area is clean, great, that is a win for everyone. but if the oligarchs are whispering in the old man's ear to develop the area, then it is not worth anything in the long run. it is not an improvement over the neoliberal order duterte sought to destroy. most filipinos have a very transactional view of politics. yes and i have made that point several times now. however there is also some instances of virtue signalling that occurs. i have met plenty of pro duterte pro lgbt types who got burned on his failure to pass gay marriage or fix homophobia in his term. i consider it virtue signalling because that wishywashy woke stuff was merely put up for sake of getting that demographic out to the polls but without actually coming up with results. you're correct that people's mindset transactional, even i have said that. however there is anomalies like marcos who have _no promises_ but the implict idea that voting for him has a direct material benefit to filipinos. that is where his support base likely comes from if all the pro marcos radio broadcasters are any hint. this is in my opinion a vulnerability that should be exploited by everyone else if they seriously want to compete. and that is why they are giving him a pass for being ""ineffective"". i can understand that perspective, though it kind of undermines the whole appeal to duterte. why not just vote somebody younger instead of him? it is why i simply cannot understand the onoff duterte running for vp then senator circus that is happening right now, and why i do not even want to comment on it. they are driven by simple tangible delivery of services and i do not disagree. i have said this exact same line before. however where i have disagreed in the past is that goods and services are just a stepping stone and we need stronger institutions in the long run. i currently do not see anybody delivering on that except _maybe_ lacson and definitely leody. they do not feel that their politicians should embody their values actually i have thought about it some more. filipinos _do_ have an ideology and do care about sides. they care about not being perceived as ""leftist"" or anything like socialism, social democratic, let alone communist. however many of them from an economic standpoint are actually themselves leftleaning. they are also willing to vote for someone who's leftist if the branding and labels are correct.",negative,positive,negative,negative,negative
