"full text of tweet an open letter to robredo dear vp leni, it was around this time in 2015 when i wrote an open letter to roxas that went viral. i suggested that he should change his campaign strategies and political messages. unfortunately, i was attacked by his supporters, so i silenced myself. this time, i will not be quiet. i'll be exhaustive. i'll make sure that this open letter will not be dismissed as a mere plethora of personal opinions. i am doing this because i do not want another government of liars and thieves. my insistence is noble since all i want is a good leader. first, your tv ad is awful. it is not inspiring. it is a trigger for depression. you want to fix the dying economy, but your hair looks dead. you want to save the hungry and the oppressed, but your face is ghostly. you look weak, sick, and tired. our hope should not look hopeless. if you have a campaign strategist who has advised you to either make people laugh or cry, fire himas soon as possible. it is already 2021. that outdated campaign strategy will not work in an era of social media, fake news, performative communications, and mass disinformation. also, dump those who tell you that radical love and calm positivity will defeat populist, nostalgic, paternalistic, and strongman politics. a culture shaped by patriarchy and machismo does not consider love and positivity masculine or strong. they belong in churches and convents. i do not want to believe that you're recycling roxas' losing campaign strategies and messages that were also calm and collected, but your campaign looks that way. his ""disente"" and ""tuwid na daan"" were like your ""radikal na pagmamahal""virtuous, effete, conceited and ineffective. perhaps you're copying the calm strategies and positive messages of noynoy aquino in 2010 since arroyo's and duterte's administrations are models for corrupt governance and oppressive leadership, but there were no mass manipulations and political fakeries on social media then. noynoy aquino won in 2010 also because his mother just died, and her death caused mass necrophilic political support from the voters who were entertained by emotional telenovelas and those heroes in their nostalgia and memory. vp leni, you do not have that mourning scene for 2022. it is possible that you want to do your calm campaign and positive messages in 2016 again, but your ""hail mary"" campaign then did not make you win. cayetano's candidacy defeated marcos. the 2016 davao region election figures say so. sadly, the cayetano of 2022 already quitbong go. i am not dismissing the fact that calm, loving, positive election campaigns do work, but that is for incumbents and current administrations' candidates like arroyo in 2004 and marcos now. they will not go berserk and negative. they have to project that they are above their opponents. winning positive strategies are not really positive. in 2004, arroyo ran a positive campaign, but his supporters did the dirty job of belittling poe. the same thing will happen in 2022marcos is running a calm, positive campaign, while his rabid supporters are attacking robredo. a positive campaign strategy that is passive and does not attack or counter is for losers. elections are wars without bombs and guns but minds and mouths. they are not for saints. even good, righteous leaders become sinners when they campaign and govern like saints after they win. now let me illustrate your ineffective campaign that'll only waste a political movement and suggest remedies using the cases in india and the us. perhaps your people will defensively say that we're filipinos, but the cases i'll cite are similar to what we have in the philippines. the 2022 election in the philippines is following the indian general election in 2019. there were two main contenders for prime ministershipmodi paternalistic, nostalgic incumbent pm and gandhi reformist, idealistic opposition leader, almost like marcos versus robredo now. modi and gandhi projected love and positivity in their campaigns, but modi's supporters used lies, insults, fabricated images, and fake news against gandhi who did not attack or counter. like robredo who is called ""bobo"", gandhi, who went to cambridge, was called pappu child. like the education of marcos, modi's is so vague that many consider him semiliterate. gandhi was so like robredocalm, love, positivity, reforms, development, etc. in the end, modi won although his previous government reeked of corruption, cronyism, economic mismanagement, etc. two things can be learned from that indian case idealistic positivity and virtuous politics are losing strategies. attacks and counterattacks are necessary to win an election in an era of social media, mass disinformation, and manufactured narratives. passiveness is surrender. another thing happened in the 2019 indian election campaign that sealed the win of modi. there was a bombing incident in kashmir. before that, gandhi looked competitive. after that incident, the majority of indians opted for modi. gandhi's positivity and idealism came off weak. i am afraid the 2022 election will follow the path of the 2019 indian election. an explosion in manila will defeat robredo who has been attacked as weak and dumb using manufactured images and fabricated narratives that are unanswered because of radical love and calm positivity. our country is misogynistic. our culture demeans what is not macho. our collective consciousness degrades weaknesses. our society is ruled by patriarchy. oh, in our politics, women leaders are labeled as whores or lunatics and always as weaklings if they are not gros of patriarchy. vp leni, you have been called ""baliw"" and ""malandi"", and the attacks have failed to define and ruin you because the people see what you really are as our vice president. sadly, you still have another tag to deal with""mahina"". radical love and calm positivity will reinforce that. i am not all about criticism. i also suggest. i offer alternatives. so, let me use obama's campaign image and positive political campaign. like you, obama was a political outsider and he relied on his strong presidential image or on how people perceived him as a potential leader. from the 2004 democratic national convention to the 2008 presidential election, obama was about an image of strengthno drama, no clowning, but authenticity and audacity. during the 2008 election, he talked about hope and declared ""yes, we can"", but he countered when attacked. obama's campaign in 2008 was, indeed, positive, inspiring, hopeful, and visionary, but his antibush supporters were busy attacking republicans and their capitalist allies and friends who made money out of coffins and body bags. they were noisy, livid, and effective. i was there. maybe your people will counter that my views are americentric. well, social media, black propaganda, fake news, manufactured images, and fabricated narratives are american inventions. filipinos are just endusers. political greed in texas is not different from that greed in davao. vp leni, there is already a template for defeating populist demagogues and their hostile supporters like trump and those maga ""deplorables"" in 2020, besides uniting. movements, attacks and counterattacks online or offline and on social media or mainstream media worked for biden. like you who are dismissed as ""bobo"" or ""mahina"", biden was also attacked as old and senile, which did not really spread and root even though it could be possible based on his age. that was so because antitrump forces were not passive and weak. every lie was countered with truths. biden had two movements of blacks and of antitrump republicans. those movements were too far from radical love and calm positivity. biden focused on policies and reforms, while his supporters made attacking trump, republicans, maga, qanon their daily duty online and offline. we should learn from roxas' blunders in 2016. because he believed in ""disente"" and ""tuwid na daan"", he and his supporters did not attack duterte's ""3 to 6 months"" and counter the fabricated images and narratives unleashed by dds. please do not let the tallano gold spread and root. here's my suggestion allow the pink movement to attack and counterattack. separate yourself from that political aggression. let that movement organize a lincoln project or meidas touch. focus on policies and reforms. your image should be of strength. after all, you are our hope. i am not really sure why you want radical love and calm positivity to define your campaign when you should be talking about corruption, cronyism, economic crisis, chinese puppetry, mass hunger, ballooning poverty, etc. any movement exists not for love and quiet. that is so sixties. even the silent salt march of the mahatma or the nonviolent protest of that black minister who had a dream was not passive or weak. nonviolence may be physically passive, but their struggle for freedom was aggressive. vp leni, please do not waste the movement that is behind you. done.",2021-12-11 12:23:27,128,0,

true. no matter how strong or good a candidate is if the supporters turnoff other people the candidate would lose. if there is no cohesiveness in the support then there is a losing bet. divide and conquer that is why most of the approaches that works is dwelling on common grounds populism. great example of this is appealing to kababayangrass roots or appealing to something commonly shunned drugs or crime. it is a good strategy but the bad thing with commonly shunned and kababayan approach is that it fails to provide a good discourse on solving the root cause of problems and it anchors on cognitive biases.,2021-12-11 17:04:42,10,0,

"super unpopular opinion.. surely i will get downvoted like hell for this but.. i really dislike leni followers and in a strange way, i also dislike leni. here's the kicker i actually really love leni for her overall values. to me, she is the most competent politician in the country for president. she is also easily the most dislikeable politician. i typically say she has the ""hillary clinton"" effect. choosing her as the main contender on the left to beat bbm jr. was a really bad move. as soon as i saw her running, i knew we will get another 6 years of shit presidency. immediately, i saw my fb feed full of my friends pretending to be willing to listen and have discourse with the typical dds crowd. ""we can do this. let's talk where it is needed. let's level with these people"", and the same friends in the next post say shit like ""dds do not talk to me, i have no time for your shit"" you cannot make this shit up.. fuck, i am the biggest dds hater on the planet and i have more discourse with dds people than all these dumb fake pretenders of ""i'll be pure and have real conversations with those people"".. it is depressing. the problem with leni is, that she primarily only appeals to the kind of people who used to be the way i used to be 23 years ago. seeing the world as very black and white. you're either of high moral values, or there is something wrong. the reality is, most of the world is complicated. god knows, pinoy voters who struggle with their livelihoods are complicated. people who vote for bbm jr. or duterte are complicated. i agree that purity as the main weapon to win this election is really inefficient. let's look at her branding pink.. not to be the bearer of bad news, but a lot of men nowadays absolutely hate this color. why? extreme feminism which constantly paints average men as a problem for misconducts of like 0.01 of men on the planet. i frankly feel kinda awful whenever i see leni crowds on the streets. leni's campaign screams ""to hell with the patriarchy!"" and it reflects in the fb posts of my leni supporting people. it gets tiring to constantly get an image projected that i am part of a problem just because i was born as a man. i get it, duterte will get a guiness world record as the world's biggest ahole. i still get annoyed that half of my fb feed frequently writes something negative about men. yesterday i saw a post by inka magnaye who if i am not mistaken is proleni who shared a post that bad driving has no gender and told men to fuck themselves for saying women are bad drivers. i googled ""gender differences men vs women"" and immediately found out in 2 minutes that men are 4 times worse drivers than women. in 10 seconds, she attacked people who need education and in the very same instance, shared an obvious falsehood. it is that alternative realitythinking of lenisupporters that gets super annoying. instead of just performing a 2minute google search to have useful discourse, leni people always need an enemy. be it men, duterte, patriarchy, bbm jr., dds voters. it gets annoying as hell to have a liberal feed of whiney idiots who have to cry about something nonstop instead of activating some of their brain cells for real substantial discourse to drive change in society. these people always act as they are the smartest people in the room but are too dumb to educate themselves on the most basic shit. when i talk with a good dds friend of mine, holy fuck man, we never ever agree on politics lol.. she could not be more hardcore ddsbbm jr., i could not be more anti. but when we talk, we have an actual exchange of ideas, instead of posting a dumb oneliner that a toddler would know is not true. when i talk to my leni friends to discuss a complex topic, i just cannot. they will literally ignore me if i say something that threatens their waytooblackandwhitereality. so they do not wanna hear anything that threatens their way of life, but they'll bombard you nonstop with how yours might be wrong. most people just wanna go on with their lives without some leftwing pinoy calling them out for having some wrong perspective on life because it is not pictureperfect enough. a struggling pinoy certainly has better things to do than being told about ""but xyz is wrong.."" how do these people expect voters to believe leni can lead them if their own followers cannot even keep up a normal conversation on fb? leni's positioning alienates every single voter who does not see everything in pure terms. leniism to me symbolizes what many critical thinkers dislike no capacity for outofthebox critical thought. people on the extreme left who always talk of high moral values tend to be as ignorant as extreme dds or bbm jr. followers in the sense that they are unable to see the world as it is. made up of complex issues, ideas variables that cannot be tackled with simple pure ideologies. i really like leni's values of her improving the country. i really want her to win. i do not think ph can survive another 6 years of unintelligent governance. but as soon as i saw her running for president and saw how it is being run, i was immediately mad at my pinoy friends, who are 99 very liberal, who just do not get it. nobody cares about you talking 247 about how everything can be done better. how everything should be clean. how everything is either bad or good. tldr pacquiao for president! charrot 😂",2021-12-11 15:53:59,14,0,

"basically, the analogy is.. ignoring reality. leni people are oblivious to what anything outside of their bubble looks like and when they are confronted with it, they tend to ignore it. anything that falls outside their definition of binary righteousness gets ignored. most hotbutton subjects like poverty, crime, drugs, corruption, they are not perceived as binary by most voters. sara duterte's recent post about un jail age is a good illustration of this imo. she analyzed the subject on multiple levels related to how an average pinoy voter probably feels instead of just ""jail time at a young age bad"". i do not think the left can win an election by pretending that half the country's opinions do not exist.",2021-12-11 16:56:36,6,0,
"oh yes no, they are completely different people. i just meant the vibe she gives off to people. i find robredo has an image issue primarily because of the way she presents herself. she seems too inauthentic to me in her speech, as if she is always making sure to present herself from her very best angle, continuously forced smiling. very similar like clinton did. robredo's flaw to me is definitely the focus on purity, transparency, decency, loving values. not because they are bad values. but because people simply do not care sa ph. ph is a country of extreme polarities. most people supported the war on drugs. i have had friends who would cheer for the death of fellow pinoys, and a day later they'll go to church and i just think ""wtf"" i do not think that these are particular values most pinoys care about. i do not pretend to know everything pinoys care about, pero to me it seems pinoys want dominance, strength, decisiveness, even if it is only a facade. i also think leni probably has done more with the average workingclass in two years than bbm jr. probably did in his entire lifetime lol.. but she just does not know how to sell it in a sexy package. pointing to her track record ai not the way, you see it all the time. she clearly has the best track record, pero you see comments online all the time asking ""what has she done?"" i may be wrong but i think to the average pinoy voter it is about what they feel the candidate can do, rather than what they can see the candidate can do. and yep i also do not think she is playing identity politics her supporters certainly do though. the gender analogy was just an example of leni supporters who ignore things they do not like seeing, which causes them to be completely shut off from the average opinion in the country. there are other examples, like some leni supporters having a tendency to ignore positive covid newsstatistics even if a ddsbbm person would point it out. the leni supporter playbook does it make the people we hate dutertemarcos look good or does it not fit into our narrative? ignore it. and yea, that is what bbmdds do. i know. that is precisely why i dislike it and find it hypocritical and made a superlong rant about how full of shit many leni voters are. it is the other side of the coin. the way i see power dynamics sa ph is that there is an extreme left leni ""country is utterly broken"", center, extreme right bbm jr. ""martial law was not bad"". the center is where it is at. you can generate 100s of charts of how transparent leni is, or how bad martial law was, or point to leni's certifications and audits. nobody on the left or right cares. pero the people in the middle just care about simple ideas, like will we get a new highway, will i get new roads, will we have fewer drug pushers in our city, etc. because of that, it is not surprising to me that bbm jr. is the big winner in current surveys. bbm jr. tells stories, leni tells facts. people wanna be sold a good life story for themselves.",2021-12-11 20:04:43,5,0,

"my own interpretation of this idea leni does not even need to pander, all she needs to do is commit to a simple ""this is what i can do for you"" platform, no matter how unrealistic, and it would get people on her side. material conditions are the 1 thing that get people to the polls. you can be boy budots, marcos jr, or another forgettable, generic corrupt local politician but as long as you promise the moon, you will win. leni needs to figure this out, and so does lacson and isko. marcos and sara do not carry this burden because even by their names, it carries the _implicit_ expectation that by electing them, the average pinoy will get richer, or have stronger purchasing power, or the country will become ""like singapore"". this is where i'll disagree their branding and campaign game is strong because they have already convinced the majority that voting for them direct uplift in quality of life. right now, leni's biggest flaw in my eyes as a middle class privileged fucker is not elitism or even this weak campaign. it is that she represents ""a band aid solution"" good enough to oppose duterte and marcos but not strong enough to actually take down the deeprooted issues that keep filipinos poor and in favor of voting populists. the average pinoy simply does not give a shit about long term consequences and is only concerned about a direct uplift to their material conditions. get to the heart of this and leni and or lacson have nearly as much difficulty in getting support. the reason i am still undecided this election for president is because i have yet to find someone maybe leody who is not just a leader but someone who can set the country down the path of _not voting another authoritarian into office again_. leni fits in the joe biden role where she is good for _this_ election cycle specifically but in the long term will just lead people down another marcos or duterte in 2028 or 2034. no different than america at the moment clamoring for another trumplike leader in 2024 who will likely launch them into war with china or some stupid shit like that. another assertion i'll disagree with is leni's campaign visibility. as a cebuano, i have yet to hear a single ad from her on radio, or see anything more than a pink banner in some random building in a narrow residential street. on the other hand, every other candidate and mainly the local politicians are hugely overshadowing anything she is putting up with. if she is spending 120 million, where the fuck is it going because it sure as shit is not here?",2021-11-30 11:38:15,13,0,

"where's the agricultural self sufficiency and widescale rural development? where's the ""boracay will have no casinos"" promise? if you look at duterte's approval rating, it is tied to peace and order. which again is pretty much an outgrowth of the drug war. duterte had a lot of broken promises, but he only had one truly big one in the election. hell, it is so influential candidates are literally taking drug tests just because of the mere accusation of cocaine use. by the way boracay is actually really clean now and he pissed off a lot of chinese people and pacquiao who literally had their properties sliced in half because they got too close to the water. i know because i visited the place several times in the pandemic, and most of the folks there were actually thrilled by duterte's ""iron fisted"" handling of the situation. do not believe your facebook feed until you have actually been to the places they claim duterte succeededfailed. a lot of it is just propaganda on both sides. the dolomite beach for instance was duterte propaganda, but boracay was definitely not a failure for duterte that is leni propaganda. i think we're arguing on the basis that voters actually have morals when in reality, i think filipino voters just virtue signal all of us, conservative, liberal and progressive and settle for lessin denial when their elected leaders fail to deliver and cover it up with excuses ""but at least he is honest"". maybe this is what we should be worrying about. no, that is leni's base primarily because you're the ones most affected by american politics. most filipinos have a very transactional view of politics. ""you build me this bridge and make my life easier, and i vote for you"". that is why promises and delivering on promises is so important. most filipinos are not entitled and driven by ideology. they do not feel that their politicians should embody their values. indeed in many regards they think that is stupid. they are driven by simple tangible delivery of services. that is why bb is the second most lauded accomplishment of duterte behind the drug war. moreover.. if duterte failed at his promises then it means he is not capable to begin with. if duterte's promises were not capable of being achieved, then maybe he should not have said them at all, but if he did not, then he'd also not have won. 65 of filipinos actually want duterte's medical records released. most in fact do believe he is sick ailing and no longer able to function and that is why they are giving him a pass for being ""ineffective"".",2021-11-30 12:45:46,3,0,

"try read the post made by up communications director in partnership with another survey firm. they are pertaining about robredo's accelerating momentum and the ''real'' survey numbers. it also talks about what the survey should look like on the pulse asia february and march survey. looks credible though. i cant paste the link because reddit moderator does not allow google and fb links so i''ll just paste the whole statement. you can search in facebook or google about truthwatch survey. here is the post truthwatch survey confirms leni momentum a new survey group ""truth watch philippines"" led by up dept of communications professor dr. dante velasco and mobilis research published their survey results conducted between march 22 to april 1, 2022 on 2,505 respondents in thirteen 13 regions nationwide, earlier today. their national tallies for marcos was 52, and 30 for leni robredo for the last week of march, or nine days after pulse asia's march 17 to 21 survey where marcos got 56 and leni robredo 24, which means that leni robredo's momentum is still unabated and continuing as marcos continue to lose steam. dr. dante velasco, like most of the academe and communications specialists, conducted the survey on urging from colleagues and friends that ""it was important for everyone to know the real numbers six weeks before the polls"". you might recall that l did a post four days ago, on april 7 entitled "" erroneum ab initio"" it went viral with 4500 shares where l disputed the pulse asia february results of marcos at 60 and leni at 15 because they willfully altered the demographic distribution from the psa. instead, their february results must be marcos at 50 and leni at 23. and that if one adds the changes reflected by the new leni momentum in their march 1721 survey where marcos lost 4 and leni gained 9, the march results would be marcos 504 46 leni 239 32 back to the new truth watch survey results for march 22 to april 1 where marcos netted 52 and leni 30 conducted nationally on 2,505 respondents who were largely from the d and e sectors, it may be reasonable to deduct 3 from marcos and add the same 3 to leni for the consideration that in the ab and c sectors where leni robredo enjoy a significant lead in preference of 89 and 74 respectively in the two sectors the final numbers until april 1, 2022 should be marcos 49 leni 33 good numbers. winning is doable and within reach if we double time on h2h and tao sa tao with four weeks to go. and the leni rallies continue to grow still in the remaining unvisited provinces. the current leni momentum supported by the numbers of this truth watch survey and the pulse asia march result of leni surge continue but at a greater speed manifested by the april 7, 8 and 9 grand rallies of leni at marcos bailiwicks of davao, dagupan and pampanga where 220,00 attended it is doable for leni to gain 12 points until may 6 where her 33 will rise to 45, and marcos' 49 will lose ground faster by at least 8 , his final numbers would be 41, ergo marcos 41 leni 45 again, leni wins! if you have inquiries on the methology, sizes of demographic results, by age, by region and other details of their truth watch survey, dr. dante velasco can be reached at his email dmvcommunications.com.",2022-05-02 15:10:00,0,0,

it is still hardly egocentric of leni to say she she will only run if bbm runs for president. the job in 2022 requires a lot of out a public servant who cares about the country. it will be tough on anyone. the president will be inheriting an economy with too much debt and a decimated tax base thanks for covid19. we really cant afford more corruption in government procurement especially if were only borrowing much of this money to keep things going. and it is also much harder to grow revenues in a postcovid world. i dont think the people who declared their intention to run fully understand whats at stake here for the next 6 years. populism and the traditional way of doing politics is not going to cut it anymore. but i can understand her very human reason to say she will only run if bbm does. dont forget bbm running for president makes it very personal for her. this guy dragged the issue and accused her of cheating and contested her win as vp while using actively using troll hate machinery against her. it took 3 years iirc until the supreme court unanimously upheld her win.,2021-09-23 10:31:50,0,0,

""shock and awe definitely did not work."" ""drug supply is still rampant."" stop if they want to save their lives. there are other jobs and they should strive to be good citizens too like most of us. so inamin mo rin na ejk lang ang kayang gawin ng gobyerno lol. nasaan yung medical at sociopolitical aspect diyan. also please stop pretending to be for the ""truth"" when you cant even cough up simple evidence for your claims. also making fun of people asking for evidence for your baseless claims is not exactly the own you think it is.",2021-07-22 23:45:18,2,0,

"you do not have foresight at all. you think, projects are created in 6yrs. for your information, projects go through a lot of phases, from feasibility study, basic engineering, detailed engineering until actual construction and commissioning and handover. some projects would have feasibility taking years. however, when it is awarded, they have schedules. and these schedules are agreed upon by everyone. meaning, they commit to complete the project in the target schedule and target budget. because if it is not finished on time, delays would need additional cost. the problem with the previous admin is they delayed many projects that should have been operational by now. supposedly, these were being studied but in reality it was being realigned to accommodate some people like the oligarchs. case in point is the grand terminal. plans were already in place building it near sm north edsa. however, the previous admin changed the plan to build it near ayalas trinoma. ofcourse, sm did not agree on that as the plan had been made aligned to their business cases. so what happened is the project was delayed for the whole of aquino admin, the grand central that should be operating right now is still under construction. this is just one example there were also issues in mrt, lrt, skyway etc. please do not take plan as accomplishment. accomplishments really are the finish products particularly if you finished them as per schedule and cost as you do not need additional budget that would take time to deliberate in congress to get approval. skyway stage 3, will never be an accomplishment of previous admin as they delayed the project. imagine, 10 completion only when it should be around 7080. every year delayed was additional cost for the project. the original cost of around 40b was doubled to 80b. imagine that. because of incompetence, the project should have been in used 4yrs ago in half cost. but because they delayed the project without contingency on how to recover the delays, project cost has ballooned. the very first project i know started in duterte that i was amazed because it was fast is the c6 road in taytay to taguig. i was able to monitor it as i bike there. it only took 1.5yrs to finish. im sure they finished it at budgetted cost and schedule. the expansion of the bridge were fast as there seemed to be progress every week. improvement of the bridge in marcos highway near sm marikina was also done in just six months. there were actually many projects started and finished. you may visit skyscrapercity.com philippines. many ribbon cuttings were attended by mark villar. i also know of an airport project were some of my friends worked. that airport was started during aquino admin. they saw the difference of how things worked compared with tugade's time. there were so much issues on procurement and subcontractors and that was only ironed out during duterte's time. you may also check skyscrapercity for many airports completed in this admin. previous admin delayed many projects. those they started, they cant even keep up with the progress. so much incompetence. they have planned for years so they should have ironed the concerns during construction. i will go first to skyscrapercity.com and provide you many list.",2021-07-21 07:44:42,1,0,

"hk is still under colonial rule, only the master has changed from westminster to beijing. the reason why people reminisce about british rule is because britain is not only a country with a political system they can look up to, but also their rule preceded over the massive growth of hk in the 60s, 70s and 80s. the brits also created a very effective civil service and eliminated most of the corruption by creating the icac. britain instituted a wide array of democratic reforms in the 80s that were rolled back by china. in fact the reason why britain did not give hk more democracy earlier was because the ccp threatened the uk against this continuously. the segregated districts were prewwii and a remnant of the wave of segregation around the world from the turn of the century. it was abolished after wwii and the defeat of nazism.",2022-05-10 03:14:25,4,0,
hk was originally part of china and the majority do not support independence so there is not really any basis to call it a colony today. their entire existence is to move wealth in and out of china so their growth tracked china and gdp doubled after reunification. and the british still pushed democracy right at the end so how much did they really fear the threats? they could have also given citizenship but fought against it even for macau. edit but that we can have people cheering on colonialism is why marcos winning is not some weird phenomenon tied only to the philippines.,2022-05-10 03:45:50,-2,0,
