The tongue of the wise makes knowledge appealing but a mouth of a fool belches out of foolishness.
Gentle words are a tree of a life ; a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit.
Control your temper for ANGER label you a FOOL.
A peaceful hearts leads to a healthy body; Jealousy is like a cancer in the bones.

"This was one of the most balanced presidential program debates so far. Although it was more like a sharing of views and platforms I really appreciated the topics on hand. Very intelligent discourse. Also it sets the bar high for politicians to really get on board with the world politics and not just nitpick all these personal issues.

I hope Gonzales and Abella can really play a big role on the upcoming government line up. Gonzales views on a parliamentary shift is really what this constitution needs. The voting parties should play a bigger role with the voting system here in the PH. The presidential system is old and passé. More representation and ideals should be put in the plate by the people to have coalitions and alliances. This makes society balanced and fair.

More of these discussions! Congratulations
SMNI. And good job sir BBM!

"Sir, i hope that all your plans translate to action when you become our next president. Filipinos don’t need complicated words but rather a simple and logical solutions to our daily issues explained in layman’s terms. May you be the president to continue the Duterte legacy so we don’t go back to square one.

You were once considered as the hope of the future just like how you see our youth becoming our next hope. We are excited to see your detailed platform in your website soon since Unity is already starting to become a movement. And after unity comes the real work.

Great stand on national issues last night during the debate. You may not solve all the problems but we will be here to help you as citizens of this country. #BBMSARA2022 #UniTeamBBMSARA",2021-12-07 00:00:00,

"Allow me to share my insight and intuition. Bong Bong Marcos is ""The Universe Choice"". He is meant to be the next president of the Philippines. It is his destiny to lead. To bring the Philippines to where his dad originally wanted us to be. We are fortunate because it in our lifetime that it will happen. Just like what his dad said-\-\Can you argue with destiny? So be it! BBM is just as surprise as you are that so many people are rooting for him for presidency. We are not saying that other presidential candidates are a bad choice or not capable to lead. All candidates are equally capable. But out of a million chance to bring the Philippines out of hardship, we only have 1 and only chance. Allow destiny to take its own course. SPREAD LOVE. NOT HATE. A decade ago, one elderly woman whom I met said ""If the Philippine HEAL.The World Heal."" This I long to see to save the future of our children and children's children. ...God bless Philippines..Pl

"The 4 candidates who didn’t attend the debates are obviously doesn’t want to take the risk of losing their votes.
Because they know the questions will be harder and intense. They have to show knowledge and intelligence (live) to people with impromptu follow up questions from panelists which I doubt they all have. These panelists are not celebrities or journalists who can just ask easy peasy kindergarten questions. Their skills are specialised in political science. Every words from the candidates are analysed and measured.",2021-12-07 00:00:00,

"Bongbong Marcos I and my grandparents used to watching Apo Marcos Speeches, especially the one he addressed the American nation under President Reagan, he was so full of admiration your dad was, for 6 years old and that was me😘

We’ve grown up in the Philippines under Martial Law never we felt like being a victim by it but in fact, we were fully secured

Then after 52 years later, there was you delivering the most admired debate on your own mission to lead our nation and push to progress not just us your supporters but to all Filipinos inside and outside the Philippines👏❤️🇵🇭🙏

Tara na Inang Bayan Kung Pilipinas gisingin mo na ang buong taong bayan upang magkaroon na ng peace and prosperity

Hint: Way to progressive nation, create affordable housing, create jobs with fair wages, create modern technology, get rid of the greedy companies such as water, energy and minimise imports that can be processed and produced locally

A creative nation will lead its people to creativity

"Jezz Aquino A gentle answer deflects anger but harsh words make temper flare.
The tongue of the wise makes knowledge appealing but a mouth of a fool belches out of foolishness.
Gentle words are a tree of a life ; a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit.
Control your temper for ANGER label you a FOOL.
A peaceful hearts leads to a healthy body; Jealousy is like a cancer in the bones.
PEACE be with you…God is ❤️",2021-12-09 00:00:00,

"This was one of the most balanced presidential program debates so far. Although it was more like a sharing of views and platforms I really appreciated the topics on hand. Very intelligent discourse. Also it sets the bar high for politicians to really get on board with the world politics and not just nitpick all these personal issues.

I hope Gonzales and Abella can really play a big role on the upcoming government line up. Gonzales views on a parliamentary shift is really what this constitution needs. The voting parties should play a bigger role with the voting system here in the PH. The presidential system is old and passé. More representation and ideals should be put in the plate by the people to have coalitions and alliances. This makes society balanced and fair.

More of these discussions! Congratulations
SMNI. And good job sir BBM!

Hope you keep your words and get them rolling. All the best!",2021-12-09 00:00:00,

You were once considered as the hope of the future just like how you see our youth becoming our next hope. We are excited to see your detailed platform in your website soon since Unity is already starting to become a movement. And after unity comes the real work.
